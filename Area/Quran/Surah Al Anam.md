## Miracles around you
- To him belongs the keys of the unseen
- Allah (swt) created the darkness and light
- The harmony of the night and day

## The cosmos
We ourselves and everything around us are proof of Allah (swt)

## Reaching out during trouble
-   It is Allah (swt) who responds to you when you reach out to him

## V:108
-   Do not curse false Gods - they may curse Allah (swt) in ignorance
-   Have academics debate and avoid curse/vulgarity

## V:91

-   When you deny prophethood, you are denying Allah’s mercy, majesty of Allah (swt)

## V:50
-   Prophet (swt) does not know the unseen, he is a mortal, a Warner and giver of glad tidings (for the believers)

## V:34

## V:140
-   Explicit prohibitions against infanticide
-   When someone is in pain, acknowledge that pain then give them the kind words

## Miracles
- Why does Allah(swt) not send more miracles?
	- Allah(swt) does *not* play games
	- When miracles come (e.g., angels), you will believe or you will get destroyed
	- Even if Allah (swt) sent a book, they will not believe, they will say it is magic
	- Even if Allah (swt) sent down angels, resurrected the dead, they will not believe
	- The life of his world seduced them
	- Allah (swt) will ask all Jinns and humans “_did no warners come to you?_”

## V:151
Ten Commandments of Islam

## V:152
-   Shan-e-nuzul - science of knowing why a verse was revealed

## Property of Macci surahs
-   Have very few rules

-   Give zakat to purify your wealth
-   Allah’s name must be mentioned while slaughtering
