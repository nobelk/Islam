- He got caught up with his wealth and lost track of the hereafter
- He felt Allah(swt) was happy with him since he had wealth (wrong assumption)

- All of his wealth was destroyed instantaneously
- Be thankful to Allah(swt) and do not be boastful

	- But good deeds are things that last forever
	- Subhanallah is such a good deed

## Story Musa and Khidr
