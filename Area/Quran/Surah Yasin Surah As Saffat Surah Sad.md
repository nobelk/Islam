# Surah Yasin
- Early Meccan surah
- Theme is to prove the hereafter or akhirah
	- Allah(swt) will bring back our souls and resurrect us

	- even your footsteps

## Story of Isa's companions
- Town of Antioch - 3 people went there to preach
	- A local person sided with them
		- his townspeople killed him
		- Allah(swt) said - enter jannah
	- He said, how I wish my people could see this, see that I was telling the truth

- Even angels express frustrations about the man
	- Who reject the truth, when warners come to them, they mock them

		 - People who deny the miracles around them will not be satisfied by any other miracle
 - Quranic arguments are watertight and appeal to every single person
