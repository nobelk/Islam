# Brief overview
> Bismillahir Rahmanir Rahim

# Surah Yaseen
- Early Meccan surah
- Theme is to prove the hereafter or akhirah
- Prophet(pbuh) recited verses from this surah to blind the Qurayish assassins

## V:12
- We shall surely revive the dead
- Whatever you do, Allah(swt) records it
	- even your footsteps

## Story of Isa's companions
- Town of Antioch
	- 3 people went there to preach
	- A local person sided with them and Allah(swt) said - enter jannah
		- He said, how I wish my people could see this, see that I was telling the truth
		- This person was compassionate toward his people

- Even angels express frustrations about the man
	- Who reject the truth, when warners come to them, they mock them

## Allah(swt) shows three ayahs/ signs
- A sign for them is the dead land - crops, grains, fruits are grown for us to eat
		- Everything is in pairs
- A sign is the day and the night for them
	- Allah(swt) control the sun and the moon
	- everyone is in their place
- Allah(swt) has given you the knowledge
	- We ride the seas, conquer the ocean

## Difference between Iman and Disbelieve
- Believer sees hungry people
	- He wants to share the blessings Allah(swt) has given him
- Disbeliever sees hungry people
	- Why does Allah(swt) not feed the hungry? Why should I feed him

- On the day of judgement
	- After the trumpet blow, they will be gathered in front of Allah(swt)
	- Allah(swt) describes the people of jannah and the people of jahannam
		- People of jannah - will be busy with entertainment
			- Whatever you want, you will be able to do that
			- They shall hear and see Allah(swt) - highest reward

- Not all species are the same
	- Allah(swt) subdued the animals for us
	- We ride them, get their leather, eat their milk and meat

 - Doesn't mankind see that Allah(swt) created them from a despised fluid
	 - Then they challenges Allah(swt)
