# Brief overview
> Bismillahir Rahmanir Rahim

## Theme
- Late Madani surah
- 9th year of hijrah
- Revealed near the final stages of elimination of paganism
- *Baraa* means cutting off all ties
- Purify the believers from within and fortifying them from without
- Context is military: battle of Hunain, battle of Tabuk
- Quran *cannot* be taken out of context: i.e., cherry-picking of verses
- No Bismillah in the beginning of the Surah
	- Companions were not sure if it is a separate surah
	- Because it cuts off times with the pagans
- Attachment to the mosque for the believers
- Establishing the connection among all believers of the ummah
- Islam is *not* militant by nature
- It is not befitting for non-believers to be in charge of the Masjid-ul-haram

## V:5
- Kill them wherever you find them
- Ultimatum to the idol worshippers - 4 months of time
- But if they ask for your protection, you have to give protection (V:6)

## Issue of priority
- Family, money, business *cannot* be prioritized over the pleasure of Allah(swt)

## V:25-26
- Only two battles in Quran are mentioned by name: Hunain and Tabuk
- Hunain took place against two Jewish tribes
	- Muslims were higher in number but almost lost the battle since only Allah(swt) grants victory *not* the number

## Munafiqs
- In Tabuk, the Muslims waited for the Byzantine empire to fight
	- The enemy did not show up
- If you don't help the Messenger (pbuh), Allah(swt) will replace you
- Your help of the religion is actually for you, Allah(swt) does not need you

## V: 75-77
- Some people promised generosity, but become stingy when Allah(swt) made them wealthy
	- Do not make excuses to avoid responsibilities
	- Do not become an armchair critique - ctiticizing someone who is doing a little
- Finding fault among others is a sign of hypocracy

## Story of Qaab Ibn Malik
- Qaab was one of those who repented
	- He was punished with 50 days of boycott

> Only thing that will save you from Allah's(swt) Azab is Allah's Rahma

## Life in this world
- Allah has purchased the life or wealth of the believers in exchange for jannah

## V:92
- Always aim high to be the best muslim and strive for it - maybe Allah(swt) will acept your intention
	- You may get reward even if you fail
	- e.g., people who could not go to Tabuk because of the lack of means (riding animal)

## V:107
- Allah(swt) forbade the Messenger (pbuh) to go to the masjid built by the munafiquns
- There may be people who use the religion for personal agendas

## V:60
- Only place in Quran where all categories of zakats are mentioned

## V:36
- Validity of islamic calendar (7 days/week, 12 months/year)
- Hijrah as the beginning was deviced by Umar

## V:102
- There was a group between the Sahabas and munafiquns
	- who mixed together good and bad deeds and who confessed their sins
	- perhaps (*shall*) Allah(swt) will forgive them

## V:128-129
- Describes the Messenger(pbuh)
	- Prophet(pbuh) loves you and is concerned about you

> If they turn away, say "Allah(swt) is sufficient for me"
