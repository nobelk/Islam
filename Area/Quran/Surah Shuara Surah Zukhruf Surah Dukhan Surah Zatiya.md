# Brief overview
> Bismillahir Rahmanir Rahim

# Surah Shuara
- Allah(swt) asks muslims to consult one another
	- While making a decision, seek advice (mutual consultation)
- Another theme is the rizq
	- Allah(swt) gives rizq to whoever he wishes
- If wants Akhirah and plants the seeds, Allah(swt) will increase his crop, if one wants this dunia, he/she will get is (notice no increase)
- If Allah(swt) handed out all rizq, His servant would have transgressed
- To Allah(swt) belongs to the heavens and earth
	- Whatever you have been given is a temporary thing
	- Whatever you have been given is a temporary thing

### Characteristics of believers
- Who gives out charities continuously
- Who takes their affairs with mutual consultation
- Who defend themselves when they are wronged
- If you forgive and reconcile, that is what the muttakins are able to do

## V:11
- How to understand divine attributes?
	- There is nothing whatsoever like Allah(swt).
	- He is absolutely unique in every way
	- e.g., Allah(swt) is the one who hears and sees
		- We know what hearing and seeing means, but *not* Allah(swt)'s hearing and seeing

- Whatever evil happens to you, happens because of your hands.  Allah(swt) forgives much because of these calamities
- No one can see or speak to Allah(swt) directly:
	- Through to messengers (direct inspiration)
	- Through wahi (by angels)
	- From behind a veil

# Surah Zukhruf
- Golden decorations
- Prove Quranic message and refute criticisms toward the message and the messenger
- No merit in argument that Allah(swt) is pleased otherwise the disbelievers would not 

## V:13-14
- Dua for journey on a transportation
- Allah(swt) distributes wealth among us
	- Every single group of people needs another group
	- Some of you will have more than others, but the socio-economic status is irrelevant related to the Akhirah

# V:61
- Jesus is a sign of the day of judgement (his return)

## V:67
On the day of judgement, the best of friends will be the worst of enemies except the muttakins

- People of jahannam ask Malek to destroy them, but Malek will say that they will remain there forever


# Surah Dhukhan
- Means dusty clouds
- Threaten those who reject the day of judgement and make them repent
- Allah(swt) describes Laylat-ul-Qadr the blessed night when you ibadat, it becomes better than 1000 months
- Those who reject Islam, they are playing around in their doubts
	- Allah(swt) warns them - wait until the dhukhan comes
- Not our job to be harsh toward those who reject Allah(swt)
	 > You wait and we are waiting too and Allah(swt) is the final judge

# Surah Jathiya
- Mankind will be kneeling on the day of judgement

## V:21
- Those who continue evil deeds, Allah(swt) will not allow them to get away, they are not the same as the righteous

- The fact that there is no justice in this world, proves that there is an afterlife
- Do not take your desires as the objects of worship
- The scroll of our deeds will be handed out on the day of judgement

> So all praise is for Allah—Lord of the heavens and Lord of the earth, Lord of all worlds.  To Him belongs *all* Majesty in the heavens and the earth. And He is the Almighty, All-Wise.
