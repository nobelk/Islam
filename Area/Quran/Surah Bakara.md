## Change of Qibla
-   The original Qibla was Kaaba
-   Significance since it announces the coming out of Islam as it comes to its fruition

-   Islam is also observing both the letter of the law and the spirit of the law

## Islamic penal code
-   Penalty of murder is execution
-   Deters the crime saving the life of both the criminal and the victim

-   The goal is to have a civil society where crime rate is low

-   Every grain grows 700 grains
-   Allah gives you more when you spend for charity
-   Kind word is better than charity followed up by bad actions

## Ayat-ul-kursi
- The greatest verse in Quran
- Whoever recites it after every fard prayer, only thing preventing him from going to Hannah is his or her death

## Last ayat of Surah Bakara
> Whoever recites this ayat at night it is sufficient for him Bukhari 4723

## Middle ayat v:143
-   We are the ummat-al wasta - a middle nation
-   We are the witnesses to the mankind
-   Just as the Rasul (pbuh) is a witness over you
-   Mankind would look up to you as you look up to the Rasul (pbuh)
